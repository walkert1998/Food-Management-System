The Food Management System is an app used to track a households food and beverages.

The user can add items to the database, edit their properties and remove them if they wish.
The properties of each food item (name, best before date, quantity of item, storage location)
is displayed in a JTable which is embedded in a tabbed pane with a tab for each storage location
plus a tab for all items, and items which are either expired or their expiry date is the current
date.
